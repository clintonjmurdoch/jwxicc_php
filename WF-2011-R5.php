<br></br>
<p>Choosing to pass up net run rate calculations in favour of another night of drinking, it was uncertain as to whether we were first or second going into the final match. In our favour was the fact that the match was not a final, due to our 0-2 playoff record (to be 0-3 by the end of the Melbourne season), while the synthetic pitch had some of the boys licking their lips,  however nothing short of a thumping win would be enough to ease the growing tension surrounding a possible maiden premiership. The All Stars won the toss and made the surprising call to send us in. They were almost rewarded immediately when O'Shea spooned one in the air, only for the catch to go begging. Had it been taken, Vaughan Garner could have easily been timed out as he loitered around the far-away toilet while wearing now illegal spikes. O'Shea eventually settled, while Warren Sidebottom continued his love for the easy two, racking up another 14. There were some big hits however, as he aimed to put one into the scorer's lap. He could manage only one six, however he narrowly missed two more after one bounced just short and another was caught by a diving fielder and thrown back into play. O'Shea's supporting role came to an end on 32, taking his tally to a Willowfest-best 140. Their partnership of 96 - off just 15.3 overs - represented the third highest opening stand and rose the Willowfest record for the third day in a row.</p>
<p>Garner endured an uncomfortable stay, scratching around for five balls before edging a cut - off the worst bowler in the team - straight into the half standing up keeper's gloves. The same bowler went for 21 in his next over, throwing up (literally) eight wides, two no balls and some legal tripe as well. Andrew Dowell restored order, briefly showcasing the form that gave him a half century in 2010, as he put on 68 in 10.3 overs with the increasingly aggressive Sidebottom. A century appeared on the cards before he skied one off the opposition skipper Lokanandi, but his 71 still represented the seventh-highest score of all time, and presently his second entry in the top 10. Matt Barclay and Dowell suffered the same fate to give Lokanandi tidy figures of 4/36, but the off spinner was only allowed 9.1 overs after taking the final delivery of one of his fallen comrade's overs. In between, Ben Mason couldn't pop his carnival (or JWXI) runs cherry in his first hit, but those wickets only served up one of the more exciting partnerships in JWXI history.</p>
<p>After slumping to 6/184 with almost 20 overs to go, Rhys Collier would have been lauded for blocking out 10 or 15 balls while Michael Dann kept the board ticking over. Instead, he had a fair dinkum crack, deciding early that the square leg boundary was his friend and aimed almost every shot in that direction. His first 10 runs were cheered wildly, but the whooping quickly turned to adulation as Collier got his eye in and started playing proper cricket shots. He still challenged the leg side fielders though, with one strike so precise that he threaded a gap no wider than 15 metres. The small crowd reached fever pitch as the partnership neared the all time best seventh wicket stand of 68, set more than three years earlier by Garner and Rory Herd in the first ever Melbourne match. The union reached 76 off just 9.4 overs before Collier tickled one behind, departing for a wonderful 27. Dann  meanwhile had crept along to an almost unnoticed 30, and had visions on his own big score with nine overs remaining, but the tail couldn't hold out and he could add only four more to his total.</p>
<p>After his golden batting run, Collier was handed the new ball by Barclay to see if his midas touch could extract some swing. The experiment lasted one 12 run over, however he still had some tricks up his sleeve, throwing himself sideways in the air to clutch a screamer off Clinton Murdoch. Now brimming with confidence, Murdoch and Barclay dried up the runs, with Barclay picking up his own wicket to reduce the All Start to 2/29. Just as the result appeared to be a formality, the heat began to sap the boys' energy, particularly that of Josh O'Dwyer, who was already struggling with injury. He took some stick from Johnstone but had the last laugh, bowling him with a straight and full delivery. He lasted just one more over before retiring for the day, leaving the remaining overs to a four-man attack, however the wicket was the catalyst for a mid-innings collapse. As usual, Dann had a big say in the proceedings, picking up two wickets in three balls, before SPL's run out tradition showed itself with Li turning one to the vacant square leg area, only to be turned back half way up the pitch after Garner sprinted across from behind the stumps and threw to Barclay, finding the batsman inches short.</p>
<p>An early finish awaited, but suddenly the yips kicked in, as Dann suffered consecutive drops in his next over; one by his own hand and the other by Garner behind the stumps. Crucially, the repreieved batsmen kicked on for a 47 run stand, during which Dann endured his first tough patch with the ball in the baggy red. Murdoch returned to remove Teasdale for 34, rounding out excellent figures of 2/26 off 10, however the new batsmen Smith continued the onslaught by frustratingly swatting good balls off the stumps to the boundary. With runs flowing and nerves shredding, Sidebottom produced a piece of magic, cutting off a powerful cover drive with a full stretch dive and throwing the ball in one motion to Garner, who removed the bails with Smith's bat in the air above the line. Lokanandi was still at the crease, but with just two wickets in hand, he targeted O'Shea, who had plugged away quietly and tidily despite the circumstances (so much so that this report only mentions him now). His second attempt at a slog flew to square leg; although Colin Finn was arguably in the better position, Garner called him out of it and just clung on to a falling catch. With Murdoch, Barclay and Dann bowled out and O'Shea one over from finishing his spell, Collier was called back to send down two of the remaining five overs. Thankfully, three balls in Barclay closed out a 71 run win with his own run out from short third man, beginning an anxious wait for the carnival result.</p>

<br></br>
<p>The team that came to be known as the Johnnie Walker XI was formed in October 2006, when a group of friends from the town of Shepparton decided to form their own side. The team played under the guise of Shepparton & Youth Club United (now Shepparton United) Cricket Club. In December 2006, 5 noble young men embarked on a fateful quest to Flanagan’s Irish Bar. The crusade was led by initial captain Warren Sidebottom, followed by shining star Simon O’Shea, Chris Taylor – the club’s first centurion, captain-in-waiting Vaughan Garner and token red-head Colin Finn. After a couple of beers to start the night, the clan spotted a promotion that offered a free Johnnie Walker “baggy red” cap with four Johnnie Walker stubbies purchased. Sensing an opportunity to wear such a cap and make the team look amazing, as well as a reason to indulge in several beverages, a decision was made to fit the entire team out in the caps. The result was 44 stubbies between 5 men, for a gain of 11 glorious pieces of headwear. The caps would become a distinctive feature of the team following the Christmas break, and the pride and fight that the team showed under the caps would set the benchmark for many seasons to come.</p>

<p>The JWXI went into recess in 2007/08, after just missing out on a finals berth, as founding members went their separate ways, but the caps continued to be worn with pride wherever required. The future direction was unclear, however before the beginning of the 2008/09 season, Taylor, who along with Garner had since moved to Melbourne, was inspired to rekindle the flame, and approached the Glenroy CC in the hope that they would host the side. Glenroy obliged, recruitments were made, head-hunting was performed (apologies to Sunshine and Flemington) and caps were purchased – this time via Ebay (recent advances in technology mean that caps are available through a thing called ‘internet’) – with the hope that all would be in readiness for the first game of the season. With a week before match day 1, Garner was given the massive honour of following in the footsteps of the legendary Sidebottom as captain, with former Shepparton resident Clinton Murdoch named as his deputy. Unfortunately, a number of near misses and player shortages resulted in a bottom two placing.</p>
<p>2009/10 saw an influx of new players, and for the first time, JWXI was able to consistently field teams with little to no change. Garner’s decision to step down gave rise to the off field/on field captaincy combination of Taylor and Murdoch, and with increased output from a number of key players, a maiden finals appearance was achieved, although the joy was short-lived following a first week exit.</p>
<p>In the meantime, plans were well underway to take JWXI to Mildura for the annual Willowfest carnival. As well as bringing the team some lovely coloured shirts to complement the baggy red, the availability of several players from both Shepparton and Melbourne resulted in an eclectic mix of past and present players, as well as some new faces in Harley Green and Travis Murdoch, who happened to be our two best players. A third placing confirmed the rise and rise of the Johnnie spirit.</p>

<p>Back for a third season in Melbourne, 2010/11 saw a changing of the guard with Murdoch, Garner and Jarryd Mills - all major contributors to the previous season's success - departing for turf cricket. As a result, Taylor was left to both control the team on his own and take the gloves. As in previous seasons, success was immediate with three wins on the trot, however Taylor's departure overseas threw the future of the season into uncertainty. Following the Christmas break, Geoffrey Williams decided to make a comeback and take the reins, however success deserted the team immediately. Another player shortage meant that, for the first time since the schoolies absence of year one, the Johnnies were unable to field a side in their division, however on this occasion the shortage was more permanent, signalling a premature and disappointing end to the season.</p>
<p>Success was more forthcoming in Mildura for the JWXI's second Willowfest sojourn. With an allstar lineup, the lads dominated the pool matches, but fell at the final hurdle as the heat and fatigue took their toll. There would be no such trouble at the 2011 carnival - consistent performances throughout the week saw the boys make history with the Johnnies' maiden flag. It couldn't have been much sweeter than pipping 2010 conquerors Kangarilla B on net run rate. The golden run almost carried the once more fully represented Melbourne boys over the line, but after suffering just two losses for the home and away season, a narrow semi final defeat cruelled the dream of back to back premierships, and left our playoff record at a poor 0-3.</p>
<p>With player numbers thinning, the Melbourne journey is over for now, leaving the Willowfest boys to continue the legacy by first attempting a title defence. The flame of a Shepparton return still flickers, with more players returning to United - the club where it all began several years ago.</p>

<p>In many respects, the Johnnie Walker XI was exactly what Vaughan Garner had been searching for since he could walk and talk. As well as having a general disdain for sporting club egos, he is not averse to quoting a useless statistic or lending an anecdote of years gone by that others have well and truly forgotten. With the JWXI being a statistician's dream and a haven for easy going drinkers, it has proved to be a perfect match.</p> 
<p>On the field, it took Garner a few matches to find his bearings. Leaking runs with the ball early, it wasn't until his third match that he made his mark, taking 3/13 against Mooroopna; a side he would markedly lift his game for at each time of asking. By the end of the season he had finished third on total wickets with a respectable 16; still the equal fourth highest total in a season. Aside from a debut 20 when the match had already been won, he generally disappointed with the bat until the second half of the season when, post wrist surgery, he passed 30 in three out of four innings. Strangely, his ability in the field was not hindered by the presence of a cast, as he tallied a total of four wickets, a catch and a runout in three matches.</p>
<p>Alongside Chris Taylor, Garner was a key player in the resumption of JWXI cricket, receiving the honour of captaining the side for the inaugural campaign in Melbourne. The leadership effect rubbed off immediately, with his batting reaching another level as he guided his team to a first-up win, stroking a solid 64* - his maiden half-century. With his batting starting to take centre stage in a weak lineup, and with several bowlers around, Garner bowled only sparingly, sending down just 24 overs for the season, compared to 70 in 2006/07. He still proved to be quite effective; not more evident than the match against Sunshine YCW, when he brought himself on and removed the opposition's two best players. His penchant for taking the ball late in an innings led to teammates suggesting he was on the hunt for cheap wickets, which was probably true. Although the team struggled, Garner could hold his head high with 255 runs and a runner up placing in the Club Champion Award, as well as affecting the most dismissals behind the stumps, taking full advantage whenever he utilised regular keeper Jarryd Mills' offspin.</p>
<p>Garner's decision to resign the captaincy had no effect on him in the 2009/10 season, with his batting improving even further. A slow start was followed by a spate of good scores, a second half-century described by himself as "the worst 66 of all time" and a chanceless 51 in the qualifying final when his 101 run opening stand with Mills almost got JWXI across the line. His season total of 348 runs again fell short of Mills, however his superior average gave him the Batting Award for the first time, although he finished runner up in the Club Champion Award once more. Returning to the bowling crease with more regularity, he added a back of the hand slower ball - or 'it' ball, as he calls it - to his repetoire, gaining a wicket and perplexing many a batsman, as well as himself due to landing it on the pitch more often than not.</p>
<p>Garner's run tally may have been even higher had he not suffered a dreadful form slump as a result of Willowfest, where a combination of turf wickets, shocking shot selection and higher class bowlers saw him scrape together a single run in four innings. His ineptness led him to wear the worst player G-string on day 3, in which he somehow bowled beautifully to pick up 2/24 off 10 against the fancied Willowfest XI. He managed to score 18 runs in the second Willowfest carnival, but was unable to pick up a wicket from his 13 overs. Instead, he contributed to the team with some high class fielding efforts, grabbing two catches and affecting two excellent runouts.</p>
<p>A return to turf cricket meant that he appeared just once in the baggy red in 2010/11, taking a career best 3/6 and steering the chase of 83 with a late 12*. The lure of the Johnnies proved to be irresistible however, with Garner returning to the fold in time for the 2011/12 season. Showing a new found hunger for runs, he notched seven consecutive double figure scores to open the season and could only be dismissed after passing 20. During Round 11, his season average stood at 97, while his home average was a mighty 161. During the same match, Garner became the first player in club history to score 1000 career runs. Despite a career best four wicket haul and a solid wicketkeeping year, a couple of lapses with the bat resigned him to his third runner up placing in the Club Champion Award, this time missing out to Mick Pataki.</p>
<p>Consolation came in the form of the 2011 Willowfest C Grade premiership, where Garner finally broke the run scoring curse of carnivals past, averaging 38 with the bat (albeit scoring only 38 runs) and playing a dependable supporting role to the stars with ball and gloves.</p>

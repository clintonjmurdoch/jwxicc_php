      <h3 style=”text-align:left”><b><u>2010/11 Season Summary</u></b></h3>
<p>It was very much a season of two halves for the boys this year. With Chris at the helm again, the uni boys dominated before Christmas, but the side gradually fell away as numerous players became unavailable. Signs were good early with a strong team effort dismantling Moonee Valley by eight wickets in round three. It turned out to be the only match in the first six weeks due to rain and forfeits. When we finally got back on, the going was much tougher, despite the one-off appearances of Millsy and Vaughan courtesy of match abandonments in their grades. After the Socials got away quickly, Vaughan (3/6) and Carree (2/13) demolished the rest of the lineup, with the remaining seven wickets falling for just 16 to be all out for 83. Despite a few hiccups, the target was reached comfortably enough with three wickets in hand. This was followed by a brutal display against Barkly St. Chris started the rot by under-arming the ball at the stumps from a Ricky delivery to earn a bizarre stumping, shortly after taking his first ever catch with the gloves, to leave Barkly St. struggling at 2/1. Some excellent bowling from Carree (3/10), Steve (2/21) and Yomi (3/27) cleaned them up for 91. The reply was swift as Marshall and Kale belted the bowlers to all parts, knocking off the target two down in just 17.4 overs. The boys came back to earth with a thud before Christmas against St. Francis – only Ben and Kale passed 10, as we were comprehensively beaten by nine wickets.</p>
<p>Chris’ post-Christmas departure left the boys without a captain. Millsy filled the breach for the first match after he was unable to play B Grade. Despite Cam’s 4/24, Haig were able to reach 159 without too much trouble. The reply looked dead in the water at 5/63, but a fantastic counterattack from Strel – who everyone thought couldn’t bat – gave us a slim hope. He finished with an unbeaten 33, out of 46 runs scored while he was at the crease, but we still fell 50 runs short. Chook took over the reins the following week against West Coburg. We fared even worse with the ball, but on a small ground 179 seemed reachable. Millsy came good with a well paced 54, and with Carree and Strel making good contributions we fell an agonising nine runs short, bowled out with four balls remaining. </p>
<p>Despite a third loss in a row against Ascot Vale, we were still well in contention for finals with four matches to play. A win over Barkly St. would have helped no end, and half way in we were well on our way after posting 5/204, thanks to Carree’s magnificent 107 off 105 balls. Carree hit 16 fours and a six, and was well supported by Chook (41 off 72) as they put on 157 runs in 25 overs for the 4th wicket. Carree’s contribution to the partnership was 90, while extras made up a staggering 32, and 40 of the overall total. With only nine players and a solitary sub fielder, the bowling had to be on song. It wasn’t – 56 extras, including 32 wides and 17 no balls smoothed the path to the target, which Barkly St. reached just three down with an over to spare. The main highlights were Chook taking his first ever catch behind the stumps after a difficult couple of matches and Marshall donning the gloves a couple of overs later to take one off Chook, moments after allowing a harmless delivery to elude him for four byes. </p>
<p>But just like that, it ended. A chronic player shortage the following week left Marshall to become the fourth captain of the season, but with just Kale by his side (there were six former JWXI players in total, but only two regulars), the match was not given JWXI status. Chook would return for the final two matches but no other players could be found, resulting in a sudden recess.</p>
<p>Carree’s century was more than enough to take out the batting award (152 runs @ 38) before he went up to C Grade, while Kale enjoyed a consistent season that netted him 122 JWXI runs and 185 all told. Carree’s all-round form meant he took the Champion Player award as well. Steve, despite only taking two wickets after Christmas and leaving the country at the start of February, surprisingly held on to win the bowling award (8 wickets @ 17.38), one wicket ahead of Coop and Carree.</p>

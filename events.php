<h4 style="text-align:left"><b>Flanagan's, Stubbies & Caps - December 2006</b></h4>
<p>As told in the <a href="history.php">history section</a>, the Johhnie Walker XI came to be as a result of some regular nighttime mischief. When Warren Sidebottom, Chris Taylor, Simon O'Shea, Vaughan Garner and Colin Finn entered Flanagan's Irish Bar in the heart of Shepparton on a typical Saturday night for a few sneaky beers, little did they know of the massive venture that they were about to create. The fledgling team's ethos was basically known at this point, however it lacked a uniform and an identity. So when a promotion giving away a baggy red Johnnie Walker cap with the purchase of four Johnnie Walker stubbies, the lads didn't have to read each others minds to know what to do. Even Garner and O'Shea, dyed in the wool bourbon and rum drinkers respectively, took a few for the team. By the end of a solid drinking session, five men had secured 11 delicious caps, and probably a nasty hangover for the following morning. The experience was so good that more troops were called in to do it all again and fit out more players. The Johnnie Walker XI was born.</p>
<br></br>
<h4 style="text-align:left"><b>Hungry Jack's Saturdays - 2006/07 season</b></h4>
<p>With close proximity to McGregor Oval and free drink refills, Hungry Jack's quickly became the post-match eatery of choice. But with a propensity to cause mischief - almost entirely the Taylor's - it was quickly discovered that food and frivolity are a dangerous mix. On several occasions, chips and pickles morphed into projectiles, plastic plants were tampered with and things in general got quite belligerent. Despite all this, even the biggest of food fights was only enough for some stern warnings from staff, who quite often carried on cleaning while the carnage unfolded. It would not surprise if some players' photos are still posted on the black ban wall.</p>
<br></br>
<h4 style="text-align:left"><b>Cas Quest - February 28, 2009</b></h4>
<p>For the final match of the 2008/09 season, the boys rocked Ascot Vale's world when they turned up in suits, in preparation for Crown Casino journey that evening. And aside from for playing purposes, they weren't removed; Vaughan Garner conducted the coin toss in his baggy red and blazer, channeling the typical international procedure, while Jarryd Mills and Clinton Murdoch were well attired for umpiring. It was a full on day for Murdoch, who traded fielding for eight beers, bowled three drunken overs and conceded 21 and had random patterns shaved into his hair en route to becoming a skinhead. The casino only riled the boys up even further. Those who went and played blackjack were treated to an overzealous female Asian dealer, whose catch cry of "Too many!" prompted Warren Sidebottom to start singing "Too Many Times", which was repeated endlessly for the duration of play. To cap the night off, Andy Taylor had a go at craps despite not knowing the rules, and after tiring of the regular casino fare, decided to ask one of the floor staff where the 3-Man tables were.</p>
<br></br>
<h4 style="text-align:left"><b>Shenanigans at O'Malley's - December 27, 2010</b></h4>
<p>After an excellent triumph over Hutt River Dedication on the first day of Willowfest 2010, the entire squad was keen to let the hair down as it ventured to O'Malley's Tavern in the heart of Mildura. From the outset it was clear that the night was going to be large when several of the lads hit the Bundy Red for a free stubby holder, while some - especially Rhys Collier and Warren Sidebottom - were determined to sample anything liquid that the bar had to offer. Things lifted another gear when it was discovered that a lovely young barmaid named Zoe shared a surname with former Mildura resident and current player Kale Cetinich. Despite both their assertions that they were not related, several boys began working overtime on wooing her. The creative peak was reached when Vaughan Garner joined Collier and Sidebottom and began mixing various spirits, eventually stumbling on a Tullamore Dew/Midori/Coke combination; henceforth known as Tullamelon.</p>
<p>From there the night quickly got out of hand. First Garner and Simon O'Shea got into an argument over something that no one could remember and decided to throw their drinks at each other (accounts of who started that are also varied). While Garner went to the toilet to clean himself up, the bouncer was on the warpath for those responsible and was told by the boys that "It wasn't us", only for Garner to return and resume the argument right near the bouncer, leading to his ejection and an early bedtime. This incident was followed by Michael Dann and Josh O'Dwyer's brazen attempt to steal two barmats. Dann was caught with two mats on his person but was told by the bouncer he could keep one, however O'Dwyer's insisted on getting two. After throwing another mat over the beer garden fence to Dann, O'Dwyer exited with Collier and Colin Finn. The only problem was that Dann's tongue got the better of him, as he returned and exclaimed to the bouncers that "I have two of them!", leading to a chase of extreme proportions. Dann tried to escape to the Workingman's Club but was tracked down by a ute carrying <i>four</i> bouncers, one of whom was on the tray. What could have been two barmats became none, but at least they let Dann go. O'Dwyer, Collier and Finn were able to escape to the motel pool.</p>

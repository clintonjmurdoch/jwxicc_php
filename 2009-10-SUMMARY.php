<h3 style=”text-align:left”><b><u>2009/10 Season Summary</u></b></h3>
<p>2009/10 proved to be a far more fruitful year for the uni boys as a regular group of players were able to gel together with consistent success. After last year’s wooden spoon, everyone was ready to make amends and give it a red hot go, culminating in a well deserved finals spot.</p>
CRACKING START
<br></br>
<p>An early batting collapse against St Albans in Round 1 left us tottering at 4/22, but with Jack “Coxy” Hancock holding up an end, taking 34 balls to make 6, we were able to dig our way out. Chris hit one of his slowest innings of all time (59 off 55...), combining well with Coxy and Clinton, before Andy and Steve put on a crucial 24 for the last wicket. The bowlers were well up to the task of defending 124, not allowing the opposition to get away. A 25 run stand for the last wicket resulted in shredded nails, but Clinton’s return and Vaughan’s introduction brought a halt to the scoring. Clinton picked up the last wicket to finish with 2/10 off 7.5, while Steve, Chris and Coop also picked up 2 to round out a 17 run win. Next up were bitter rivals Pascoe Vale. Once again the top order failed to fire, though much of this was the team’s own doing – Vaughan and Millsy’s anyway. First Millsy ducked underneath a full toss only to be bowled, but despite the no ball being called by square leg, previous experience with the matter led Vaughan to rule Millsy out from the sheds. Subsequent research and enquiries to the MCC have since proved fruitless. This was followed by Millsy giving Vaughan out caught behind off the pad, leaving us at 4/33. Solid outputs from Dolf, Andrew Hewitt and Johnny Derwent got the innings to a defendable score, however it was Coop and Carree who really stole the show, hitting the bowlers to all parts for a competition high 55 runs for the 10th wicket. Pascoe Vale’s reply got off to a terrible start when the non striker could not beat Carree’s bullet arm to Millsy on the first ball. With only 8 players, someone needed a score, but another economical performance from Clinton and Coop’s only catch of his Glenroy career to date, via a Millsy deflection, led us to an emphatic win. Our record would soon be 3-0 after a dominant 152 run victory over Royal Park. Millsy finally went onto the big one, making 102. His century, coming off 98 balls, was not without incident as he was dropped after smashing a hook shot to short square leg, somehow convincing Dolf that there was a run on. Result – Dolf run out , Millsy still perched inside his crease. Millsy and Vaughan put on 77 for the 6th wicket to guide the score to 7/206. Vaughan would likely have remained not out but, seeing a slow bowler and an open leg side, went for piccione points. Instead, he copped a blow to his unprotected nether region, and, deciding not to retire hurt, skied the next ball straight back to the bowler. A team effort in the field left Royal Park reeling at 7/30 at drinks, before some extreme experimentation (Marshall bowling?) allowed them to reach 54. Personal thanks from Vaughan for the batsman that walked after no appeal from the bowler with the reasoning that “I think I hit it”, and Coop for the only club umpire to give us an LBW all year which, although being plumb, was probably only given because the umpire wanted to go home.</p>
HISTORY REPEATING?
<br></br>
<p>2 losses in a row brought back bad memories of last season when, having won the first 2 games, everything fell apart. Playing Barkly St. on an absolute minefield of a ground, stopping runs was never going to be easy, especially when higher grade players are dropped back to beat us. On this occasion the bloke made 101*, although this was achieved thanks to incompetent scorers with the book showing 96 (this report could not possibly fit the rest of the errors). The first wicket was something of an anti-climax. The ball carried to Marshall at fly slip as the rest of the team watched in complete silence, before erupting when the catch was taken. The fact that we came close to chasing 215 was thanks to three big contrasting innings. Millsy hit everything that came at him in his 48 off 42, Vaughan started slowly before accelerating to 46, and Marshall held up an end in his 59 off 91. Unfortunately, he also ran out Chris for a golden duck, just as we needed to up the scoring rate, and we were all out for 195 in the last over. Two weeks later we faced ladder leaders Moonee Valley. A quick 64 from Marshall and a slogged 33* from Vaughan got us to 6/163. Although the bowlers kept it tight, dropped catches and a lack of wickets meant a last over loss. A minute later, the rains came.</p>
SOLID MID-SEASON
<br></br>
<p>The rebound started in a bizarre match against Haig. After restricting Haig to 8/144, we made a solid start reaching 2/63, before an inexperienced middle order put on a collapse of 5/6. Vaughan, on 21, watching the carnage at the other end, thought the game was up, then a different type of carnage ensued, thanks to Chris’ blitz. The next 2 overs before drinks gathered 23 runs, and 4 overs after drinks the match was over after a further 53 runs were smacked. Chris’ 51* off 19 balls, including 9 fours and 2 sixes, probably will not be beaten for some time, while Vaughan’s 37* and ability to stay at the crease for Chris proved almost as important. Next was a comfortable victory over Sunshine. Clinton, Vaughan and Chris suffocated the batsmen; all three of them went for less than 2 runs an over from a combined 20 overs. The chase was comfortable, despite steady wickets, thanks to Millsy’s stonewalling and Dolf’s bravado, and was completed in the 26th over. To make sure there were no doubts about the result, first Clinton got 4 overthrows to finish on 6* off 2, then Dolf hit a straight 6 to finish 12 runs ahead.</p>
RUN TO THE FINALS
<br></br>
<p>First up after the Christmas break was a carbon copy loss to Moonee Valley. Chook and Kale being bowled by the slowest, highest balls you are likely to see in the same over didn’t help the cause. Another loss thanks to St. Francis smashing us around the park (7 dropped catches and more high grade players contributed to the downfall), followed by a loss of points in our win over Barkly St., meant we were on the verge of missing the finals again. Mind you, we probably got lucky here – Vaughan was dropped twice on his way to the worst 66 of all time; only batting properly after some friendly abuse from umpires Clinton and Millsy, Kale defied his season average of 9 to belt 47 off 35 balls, we took a turn at pinching A grade players from Shepp and Chook bowled a fair bit of filth to go with maybe 1 good ball, and still took 3/9 off 4 overs. And...
<ul><li>Chris’ ridiculous low catch on the fine leg boundary to give Chook his first</li>
<li>Vaughan defying gravity to almost pull in a stunner at cover, however it would have given Chook a 4th wicket</li>
<li>Chris getting an easy runout to finish the match - while conversing with the square leg umpire</li>
</ul>
An easy win over Haig (Marshall took 2/20 to ‘star’ with the ball and Chris took his Haig tally to 92 off 45 for once out) was countered by a poor loss to the Socials, meaning that we had to beat Royal Park to ensure finals action – and another shot at the Socials. Some complacency late in the innings allowed them to make 7/166, and although we were struggling a little at 3/57, Clinton’s 59 and Millsy’s 45 gave us a comfortable win.</p>
QUALIFYING FINAL
<br></br>
<p>A tight opening spell from Clinton suffocated the Socials early and the benefits were felt at the other end with Dolf coaxing the hack opener into a soft shot to Kale at cover. The other opener was hitting the ball at will though, and they were able to reach drinks at 1/89. Vaughan bowled the #3 first ball on resumption, but that only brought the 2 best batsmen in the team together. A number of dropped catches hurt us greatly, but with the most surreal thunderstorm any of us ever likely to see settling in, (we only left the field after it put half the ground in near darkness – harden up ICC), we were given a night’s respite with the score reading 2/111 in the 22nd over. We should have stayed in bed.
Steve, Chook, Marshall and Coop were unavailable for day 2 and we could only get 8 on the field. Coop’s absence was particularly damaging after going at just 3 runs per over the previous evening. After much toiling, Clinton finally got a reward, removing the other opener for 82 – about 70 more than he should have got. Vaughan then delivered the most delicious of his ‘it’ AKA slower balls to get an LBW, but the damage had already been done, and we were left to chase a tricky 227 on a slow outfield.
Millsy and Vaughan made a mockery of the chase early with a magnificent, chanceless partnership of 101 by drinks. There mustn’t have been enough sugar in the cordial though. Millsy poked around at some innocuous leg spin, then tried to launch one over square leg, only to fail by a couple of metres, departing for a lovely 52. Vaughan then got tied up at one end, succumbing for 51 as he tried to break the shackles as the asking rate got higher. Chris and Clinton kept us in it for a while but in the end it was just out of reach. At the end of the day though, 199 was a terrific effort and our second highest team total for the year. Coming from 4th place, a semi final berth was available if 1st and 2nd both won, but Moonee Valley – missing their captain – lost to 6th, and so we were knocked out. At least Moonee Valley went out the following week.
All up though, it was a big improvement on last year. We won 5 more games, ran the minor premiers close twice, smashed the eventual premiers in Pascoe Vale and were consistently competitive thanks to some marked improvement from the entire core playing group, including;
<ul><li>Millsy’s second 350+ run season in a row, and Vaughan’s first 300+ run season</li>
<li>Chris and Dolf both making over 200 runs (4 this year to 3 last year)</li>
<li>Marshall again almost making 200 despite missing 3 games</li>
<li>Clinton and Coop both taking more than 15 wickets (none last year) and Chook and Dolf taking 10</li>
</ul>
Millsy’s 369 runs, 3 wickets and 21 catches (19 as keeper) earned him back to back Club Champion trophies, Vaughan took the batting average with 348 runs at 34.8 and Coop was able to sneak the bowling average with 16 wickets at 16.81, despite Clinton’s 17 wickets.

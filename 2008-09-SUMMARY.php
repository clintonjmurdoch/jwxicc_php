<h3 style=”text-align:left”><b><u>2008/09 Season Summary</u></b></h3>
<p>The season started on a positive note for the uni boys as they notched their maiden win in the Glenroy colours by chasing down 151, despite Millsy giving 3 lbw’s in 5 balls. The following week was even better as the boys reached the 229 run target with only 5 wickets down. The win was especially significant as Ben Perry – a man whose entire cricket career consisted of a golden duck, stuck around with Millsy for a 110 run partnership, stroking a quickfire 44 in the process. Unfortunately, no one had picked up the fact that Ben had played for Sunshine the year before, so the points were stripped, and from there the season quickly went downhill. We had to contend with 2 A-Grade players against The Socials in Round 3 – subsequently the match lasted little more than 30 overs.</p><p>A terrific performance in the field against Royal Park in Round 4 left us chasing just 133 for victory. Sitting pretty at 1 for 69, a string of terrible shots and dodgy umpiring decisions left us reeling at 7 for 79. Still, we almost reached the goal, but 2 wickets in 2 balls carved us off at 128. And so began a streak of 8 consecutive losses.</p><p>Perhaps the game that typified the performance of the time was in Round 9 versus Sunshine. The boys had done well to keep the ladder leaders to 5/168, before Chris Taylor went on a rampage, having 2 batsmen caught at cover by Clinton Murdoch. The hat-trick ball went along to the familiar script, however Clinton proceeded to drop the lollypop. Things were made worse when Chris picked up another wicket next ball. It would have been the only instance we know of where a tennis player has made a century and taken a hat-trick. The tragedy of the near-miss was compounded by the capitulation that was 77 all out, despite Vaughan Garner’s knock of 37, who departed when the score read 7 for 66. Dave Lyons was the next highest scorer with 9.</p><p>The long wait for another win finally ended when the boys racked up 6 for 269, with each batsman getting into double figures. Employing an umbrella field worked wonders as 2 run-outs were picked up – 1 as the batsman took a suicidal single to silly mid on, and another when Chook Williams dropped a sitter, allowing Dave the chance to hurl one into Coxy who did the rest (amazingly, a similar run-out had been achieved the previous week). The match meandered dreamily from then on, as the lads basked in the 94 run win.</p><p>Millsy enjoyed a watershed year, scoring 386 runs, pouching 7 catches with the gloves (and 2 without) and showing he was no slouch with the ball either, snaring 5 wickets to slot into equal third for the team and ultimately the overall award. By achieving this, however, he allowed Vaughan enough time with the gloves to pick up 7 catches – 3 of which came in the last game - and 2 stumpings to sneak the ‘keeper’s prize. Chris had some deadly spells with the ball to take the bowling award with 13 wickets.
Last place did not do justice to the boys’ talents – it was simply a case of almost, but not quiet. </p>

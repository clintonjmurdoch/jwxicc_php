      	<h3>Matt Barclay</h3>
	<p class="player">With some magnificent bowling performances, a breakthrough batting effort and shrewd leadership, Matt Barclay is fully deserving of the title of first JWXI premiership captain, and now enjoys comparisons with that other great cricketing leader in Hansie Cronje (minus the match fixing and plane crash). The challenge now will be to keep the momentum going with an changed squad. The stage is set for him to own the field in the manner of Garry Sobers - rumour has it that he has been practicing his left arm varieties in the off season. Eight wickets for the 2011 carnival was enough for third place and included a career best 4/21, followed by a new PB of 49* the next day.</p>

	<p class="player">After a reasonable start to his JWXI career on the 2010 Willowfest trip, monetary problems meant the youngest Barclay was unavailable for the 2011 premiership breakthrough. He will be relied upon to fill the bowling void left by Simon O'Shea's injury, which he should do with ease now that he has passed 21 and moved into adulthood. Indeed, it is likely that every wicket will be celebrated with a loud cry of "I'M A MAAAAN!".</p>

He has proven he has what it takes in big games though, having single-handedly almost delivered an incredible win with the bat in last season's Melbourne semi final. Goggles, as he likes to be called, also showed what a handful he can be on helpful pitches, tying Ray White's Dirty Dozen in knots as he played a crucial role in premiership defining win.</p>

It seems no one likes a showoff, yet any potential jealousy of the man with the golden locks had no ill effect on the premiership win. With Simon O'Shea out of the picture, can the star allrounder woo the group and snare enough votes for the prize? One thing is for sure; the sound batting and bowling variety Dann brings to the team is critical to its success.</p>

	<p class="player">Garner continued the arduous task of rebuilding a shattered batting record in 2011, using up plenty of red ink en route to averaging 38. Despite bowling some balls more at home in a special school, he still managed to pick up  three wickets in two matches before taking the gloves. Although he performed neatly enough, Garner might not get another shot after nearly forcing skipper Matt Barclay into suspension for slow over rates, thanks to regularly delaying games for several hours by compulsively destroying wickets.</p>

<!-- START WARREN SIDEBOTTOM -->

      	<h3>Warren Sidebottom</h3>
	<p class="player">While 'only' finishing third in the Club Champion Award, Sidebottom arguably won the 2011 premiership by himself on the final day, following a rollicking 71 with a stunning runout that all but sealed victory. It all seemed so easy for the great man, which begs the question: can the Messiah get better? Now boasting a solid Mildura record, a similar output to last year will be enough to put the Johnnies in contention.</p>

<!-- START DAMIEN TAYLOR -->

      	<h3>Damien Taylor</h3>
	<p class="player">Making a return after a three year sabbatical, the eldest Taylor is a strong favourite to claim the Emily Award, having plenty of experience in the area, however he will be up against a number of quality contenders. On the less important cricket side of things, Taylor has turned himself from a bit part player in the 2009 carnival into a very effective bowler in recent times, boasting a seven-wicket haul, and will add plenty of depth to the side this time around.</p>

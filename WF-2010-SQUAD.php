      	<h1>Willowfest Squad 2010</h1>
      	<p class="note">
      	2010's Willowfest squad promised to be our second ever, with some handy inclusions to the social club in Patty Lahn and Rhys Collier covering the loss of arguably our biggest piss-head in Damien Taylor. Less significantly, there was also the inclusion of some talented cricketers to cover the loss of two of our best players from 2009 in Harley Green and Travis Murdoch.

      	<h3>Matt Barclay</h3>
	<p class="player">The local lad had a reasonable maiden campaign as skipper last year, guiding the Johnnies to 3rd place and finishing 2nd in total JWXI runs. In his second spell as a permanent squad member, Barclay will go into the T20 matches with plenty of confidence following his maiden A-Grade half-century in the Shepparton T20 competition. With his bright yellow helmet (AKA the rock of Lance) finally discovering a shirt of similar colour and substance and with plenty of local knowledge at hand, Willowfest 2010 could be a breakout year for the man popularly known as Barllat.

	<p class="player">After a slow start to his JWXI career, the hairy man blossomed into Yeti last season, suffocating several batting line-ups with his tight line and length and ability to swing the ball. However, with this year&#8217;s accommodation being located in close proximity to Willowfest beer HQ, combined with his love of an ale or two, it is questionable that he will be able to either a) play a match, or b) socialise regularly with the group at HQ after day one, following his Gold Coast holiday two years ago, when he was kicked out of the same pub four nights in a row.

Mildura aside, Garner has been a rock solid contributor for JWXI, especially since the move to Melbourne, and will no doubt be called upon to bowl some lengthy spells, provided that a comfortable G-string can be found. He is set to become just the second person, after Chris Taylor, to play 47 matches on day one of the carnival.

JWXI is praying for the latter, for baggy reds aren&#8217;t happily handed out to blockers. As long as he stays away from the bathroom mirror and concentrates on cricket rather than turkey slapping, there shouldn&#8217;t be a problem.

A destructive player with bat, ball or gloves when on song, Sidebottom is a welcome return to a side lacking the required resources to summon god-like powers. He will improve the team through his exuberant personality and sexual aura alone, while his off-spinning ability could prove to be an X factor in a bowling attack full of part time right arm straight break bowlers.

His recovery has put a chill down Hutt River Dedication&#8217;s spine with Collier hell bent on revenge. All that&#8217;s left to turn promise into super-stardom is for Matt Barclay to channel Arjuna Ranatunga and refuse to allow Collier&#8217;s ugooglies to be called for chucking.

      	<h3>Patty Lahn</h3>
	<p class="player">A mystery wrapped in an enigma, Lahn was an early JWXI regular who belied a tranquil exterior to snare 2/24 off 7 overs on debut. His form floundered quickly thereafter as he set his sights on becoming a wholesome blonde country pop artist, but the emergence of Taylor Swift, combined with his entrapment in the Darktown Strutter juggernaut, has led Lahn to come out of retirement to testify to a new generation with his oratory skills and on-field antics..

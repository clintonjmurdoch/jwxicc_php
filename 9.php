<p>Founder, century maker, captain, equal games record holder, most wickets, most sixes, best bowling and so nearly a hat-trick; Chris Taylor and Johnnie Walker XI go hand in hand. Originally a glorified tennis player, Taylor joined his mates in an unprecedented cricketing movement for a bit of fun and emerged as one of the finest all rounders of his generation.</p>
<p>In an all-round team, his impact as a hard hitting batsman and new ball bowler was immediate without being earth shaking, setting an early high score mark of 43 while taking regular wickets. It was as soon as the eighth JWXI match that he would plant his indelible mark on the team with the first JWXI hundred. Despite being dropped several times and bowled via a beamer and his own bat, Taylor dominated the attack. Requiring 16 off the final over (which was only confirmed following the innings), he hit a four ball sequence of 6, 4, 4, 3 to reach the landmark; 12 fours and 4 sixes a sign of things to come. A solid season of quick runs and timely wickets saw him finish second on both lists and prove his cricketing legitimacy.</p>
<p>A season long JWXI hiatus meant Taylor was forced into higher grade cricket, but upon moving to Melbourne for work, he was keen to re-establish the flegling tradition of the Johnnies and sought out players and a club to host a side. A calm, quickfire 34 - pivotal runs to a tough round one chase - suggested his batting had developed a mature polish to go with his hitting ability, however consistent runs proved hard to come by in a season where he averaged just 16.64. His bowling on the other hand became arguably more penetrative - crucial to a struggling side as high profile recruit Clinton Murdoch struggled for wickets - and it was no surprise that he finished with the Bowling Award. The highlight (or lowlight, depending on perception) was undoubtedly his spell of three wickets in four balls, interrupted only by a dropped hat-trick ball by Murdoch. His fielding also improved markedly; not more evident than in a startling grab at short leg off a full blooded pull shot.<p/>
<p>The second season at Glenroy saw Taylor assume the captaincy for the first time. Despite a lack of tactical nous, his man management skills kept the side in good order on the field and suitably refreshed off it. The responsibility rubbed off on his performances immediately, scoring a relatively unhurried 59 off 55 out of 124 (7/95 when he was dismissed) and backing it up with 2/21 to guide JWXI to their third season opening win in a row. It would be the only time of the season that he took more than one wicket in a match, but his runs continued to be scored at critical stages. The most staggering example of this came against Haig Amatuers. Chasing 145 for victory, JWXI was struggling at 7/69, having just lost 5/6, before Taylor came to the crease and proceeeded to launch the bowlers to all parts of Cook Reserve. In an unbeaten eigth wicket partnership worth a record 77 runs and lasting just six overs, his contribution was a scarcely believable 51 off 19 deliveries, including nine fours and two sixes. At the other end, Vaughan Garner - who was on 22 when the carnage unfolded - was left stranded 13 short of his own half-century.</p>
<p>Taylor's experience at JWXI's historic first Willowfest tour was mixed. With the ball, he enjoyed two satisfying matches. On day one, he brought up Hutt River's match winning runs with a deliberate high wide that went for four to deny Jarryd Mills a judas half-century, while on day two he scythed through The Future's batting lineup in a T20 match to finish with 5/19 (his maiden five wicket haul another JWXI first). For good measure, he unleashed a bullet throw runout from half a metre away. However, like fellow Glenroy players who embarked on the trip, his batting struggled to adapt to turf wickets and high quality bowling attacks as he finished with just 10 runs.</p>
<p>Back in Melbourne, Taylor's contributions helped guide JWXI to a maiden finals campaign. Against The Socials in a qualifying final, he brought up his 47th match, qualifying him for an unprecedented fifth nomination into the Hall of Fame. In an eventful match played across two days, a typically audacious 36 almost brought JWXI home. Due to his absence from Willowfest 2010, it remains his only final. Determined to continue the success despite the loss of key players to turf cricket, Taylor took the reins for a second time in 2010/11, however his season was restricted to just four matches due to rain and his decision to move to Canada for study following the Christmas break. The first three matches all yielded wins as he took a back seat, bowling just once and not batting. Instead he donned the wicketkeeping gear for the first time in his life on two occasions. The same hand eye co-ordination evident in his batting was on show immediately as he settled into the role with two catches, a stumping off a quick bowler while the batsman had a nap and a general assuredness behind the stumps.</p>
<p>It has been confirmed that Taylor will be back again for another crack in a new competition. With the return of a number of old stars, he will be free to fill his old roles. His ability to do so will be vital to his team's fortunes.</p>

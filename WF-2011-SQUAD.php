      	<p class="note" style="color:red">
      	After a runner up placing in 2010, the boys in yellow (yes the shirts have arrived) will be looking to go one better at this year's carnival. Ben Mason will join the crusade for the first time - two years after his only JWXI appearance - while Melbourne regular and former Mildura resident Kale Cetinich has replaced Chris Barclay to enhance the batting depth. It has also been confirmed that Pete Barclay will pull on the Johnnie shirt again for at least one match.

      	<div class="info">
      	<h3>Matt Barclay</h3>
	<p class="player">Back at Willowfest for a third crack, Barclay will be looking to lift his output with the bat after a disappointing 2010 campaign (by his standards anyway - 34 runs was still 5th best for this mob). His bowling was far more valuable, picking up five wickets while going for less than three an over. With Kangarilla B out of the picture, 2011 may be the year that Barclay finally lifts the trophy.</p>

	<p class="player">Absent from the Melbourne Johnnies for season 2010/11, Murdoch made up for lost time by dominating opposition batting lineups at last year's carnival. 12 wickets at 8.33 was comfortably a team high and enough to earn JWXI's maiden selection in the Lencia XI Team of the Carnival.  His tail end batting also proved sound, however his pre-carnival drinking talk failed to translate into big results, lacking a definitive off field event. If he can add that to his belt this year, the Johnnies may prove to be indestructible.</p>

Unfortunately, luck deserted him with ball, sending down 13 wicketless overs, and rumour has it he is purchasing a fresh G-string to aid his recovery. Several excellent feats in the field meant that he was not a complete retard. Garner proved to be a surprise player in off field events however, helping invent Tullamelon, getting in a beer fight with Simon O'Shea and getting kicked out in the one night.</p>

Off field he was arguably more impressive, acquiring bar mats and having the gall to antagonise several bouncers to the point that they chased after him in a ute. His form in both aspects will be crucial to JWXI's chances this year.</p>

	<p class="player">After experimenting with straight breaks and taking time off bowling in Willowfest 2009, O'Shea rediscovered the touch of old last year, picking up seven wickets while suffocating the middle order.  He also opened up in the 50 over games and, despite a lack of runs, never failed to take the shine off the ball, soaking up 104 balls over the week - the second most for the Johnnies. He finally picked up his first JWXI duck in his 21st innings - much to the delight of Vaughan Garner, who declared him not out when caught behind first ball while the two were still duckless late in 2007. Garner had hitherto notched up 7.</p>

	<p class="player">The Messiah returns to the fold and JWXI make the grand final. Coincidence? Doubtful. Sidebottom came into last year's carnival with a cloud of inconsistency hovering over his career record, and left it having played four solid innings in a row. Unfortunately, like many others, his one poor knock came at the most crucial time, but his efforts had already gone a long way to getting the team to that point. His offspin was only utilised for a single expensive over, but Michael Dann's emergence made up for it. Besides, it allowed him more time to prowl in the slips cordon, where he was at his brilliant best.</p>

Starting out with a handy 2/11 in the first match, he was given a chance up the order (#6) in the first T20 and whacked his way to an unbeaten 78 off 43 balls, despite a previous cricketing high of just 27. The innings featured some of the most crisp hitting ever witnessed by the baggy reds. A couple more cameos gave him 122 runs for the carnival - a JWXI high - while his bowling was impressive enough to land the Club Champion Award. Due to his hitting form however, he took the Johnnies' spot in the Willowfest Whack, where he could manage just half the distance of the front runners - a small blight on an otherwise fantastic week. The pressure will be on to reach the same highs again this year.</p>

      	<h3>Colin Finn</h3>
	<p class="player">Despite making a name for himself as a sometime quick, Finn was content with having fun on and off the field while providing handy contributions with the bat, including a smoking cover drive in the first T20 and some late order stonewalling efforts. But let's be honest - all we want to see is Big Red having a bowl! Although a six would also be nice. It's not too much to ask.</p>

      	<h3>Rhys Collier</h3>
	<p class="player">Ace drink running aside, Collier provided some memorable moments to the 2010 carnival, including an astonishing 11 ball opening over (including a wicket) in the T20 against Hutt River and a quickfire 8 in the same match, taking his total JWXI runs to 13 - 12 of which have been in boundaries. It is rumoured that he will be adding DJing to his repertoire this year, while he will also unleash some new JWXI related fashion accessories.</p>

      	<h3>Patrick Lahn</h3>
	<p class="player">Deciding he wouldn't last long with an orthodox batting technique, Lahn turned to a more familiar baseball stance with unexpected results. A nine and an unbeaten zero in two innings gave him the seventh best average in the team - not bad for a drink running hippie! He will again combine with Collier to add amenity to the long cricket day.</p>

	<div class="info">
      	<h3>Kale Cetinich</h3>
	<p class="player">After an extremely slow start to his JWXI career, Cetinich has become a vital cog in the Melbourne batting lineup, scoring 122 runs at 20.33 during the truncated 2010/11 season to finish runner up in the Batting Award. Gaining a late call up at the expense of the penniless Chris Barclay, he will add much needed batting depth, while his fielding in the point region will be highly valued. As a former Mildura resident, he should take heed from several other Johnnie ex-citizens that home ground advantage does not guarantee results. Much of his off field time will be devoted to proving that Zoe Cetinich is not a relative of his.</p>
